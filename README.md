## Notes:
- Test scripts use standard meterpreter binary, which Windows Virus & Threat Protection will remove if `Real-time Protection` is enabled. You will need to disable this for test script to pass if you're running on Windows.
- I've only tested this on imgur with the `PNG` format.
- Haven't tested a binary larger than 1.12mb.
